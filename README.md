## Extension Recommendations
[vscode-bitburner-connector](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) ([vscode extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bitburner.bitburner-vscode-integration)) to upload your files into the game

[vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) to use live linting in editor

[auto-snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.auto-snippet) to automate inserting the file template in `.vscode/snippets.code-snippets`

There is a workspace file in `.vscode` which contains the recommended settings for all of these

## How to use scripts

(please note, all scripts are .js in the game and compiled from .ts)

`run_coordinator.ts` starts process of bin-packing nodes with worker tasks. It runs in a loop and assigns threads to work on weak, hack or grow.
Only eligable targets are considered:
* for hack only with low security and >95% money
* for grow only with low security
* for weaken everything else

Coordinator uses all hosts including home. However will keep a reserve of 128GB at home. Tunable in coordinate/capacity.ts

To open new hosts use `run_opener.ts`. This script will periodically scan hosts and try to hack them running port openers if they are available

## Deugging

For debugging bitburner on Steam you will need to enable a remote debugging port. This can be done by rightclicking bitburner in your Steam library and selecting properties. There you need to add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` [Thanks @DarkMio]
